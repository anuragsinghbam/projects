00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:01,160
In this video I will tell you my story,

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:03,800
how I learned coding by myself and how

3
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:05,680
I took the job of a software engineer

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,590
and why I left my school and college studies after 10th.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,590
Yes, after 10th I only studied in 11th.

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,560
After that, I did

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,120
not complete any formal education, yet

8
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,920
I have been working as a software engineer for 3 years,

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,350
so I will tell you this whole story and

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,000
how you too can learn regardless of

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:27,680
your qualification or your

12
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:30,920
background.

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:32,800
can also become a coder, you can become a software engineer

14
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:35,000
and you can also get a job, so

15
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,480
first let me introduce myself,

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,520
my name is Anurag Singh and I

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,870
am a software engineer. For the last 3 years,

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,360
I have been working as an engineer in Bangalore.

19
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,710
working as a software engineer. The name of the first company I joined

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,560
was Digit Insurance. Now

21
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:49,320
I work remotely for a UK based company.

22
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,160
I come from a small village named

23
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:53,350
Birwa Bhani in UP, which is in Gonda district.

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:55,760
am near Ayodhya and

25
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,870
I have been there for the last one and a half year.

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,720
I have created a complete course on front end development

27
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,120
which you will get on youtube's. In

28
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,950
it in the form of a playlist,

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,800
I covered every single thing which is

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,480
required in front end.

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,440
many children have studied from it and they

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,950
also got jobs and many children are studying every day,

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,360
watch and comment every day, they like the

34
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,040
course and my family

35
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,520
background is of agriculture, my father,

36
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:24,240
my grandfather, everyone was a farmer and I.

37
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,350
farming with them, used to go to the fields, used to do

38
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,440
all the work of the farm,

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,920
although I, my father used to

40
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,470
drive the car along with farming, he was also a driver

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,360
and my education is from one to eight.

42
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:38,280
My education till then was in Hindi medium.

43
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,400
I studied in Hindi medium first from class one to

44
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,920
five in Saraswati Shishu Mandir, then from

45
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,920
six to eight I studied in a government school

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,640
and I had a lot of interest in science from the beginning

47
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,110
because when we used to sleep at night.

48
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,880
My father used to sleep on the terrace, used to

49
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,920
talk about aliens, used to talk about other planets, used to talk about

50
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,360
many things, how is day and night on earth, used to

51
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,840
talk about all these things, so I

52
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,470
had a lot of interest in science, that is

53
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,520
why I used to read my syllabus book.

54
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,120
I used to read other books which were any science

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,720
books. When I was in eighth six seventh eighth,

56
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,880
I used to

57
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,480
read science books of class 10th on demand, I used to

58
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,590
bring books of my cousins ​​and I used to

59
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:22,000
read from them.

60
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,160
is, I used to get good marks in the middle of 7080.

61
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,520
I never topped and there was no pressure from my house

62
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,080
either from father or mother, we just used to

63
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,200
study.

64
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,120
and whatever interested us, whatever we liked,

65
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:39,800
we used to study the same and then in the middle,

66
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:41,390
I started getting very interested in Maths. The

67
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,640
reason for getting interested in Maths was one of

68
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,040
our Sonu Bhaiya, he took a lot of

69
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,960
interest in my Maths.

70
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,590
that we can measure the height of the tree we are looking at without

71
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:55,070
climbing it. How can we measure the height of the tree with the help of Maths? There is

72
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,520
a trigonometry in Maths,

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,760
after that I started getting

74
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:01,480
very interested in Maths too. I felt that it was

75
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,080
real.

76
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,870
so I got interested in science and maths

77
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,230
because of my father, I got interested in maths

78
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,680
because of Sonu Bhaiya, then both of them

79
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,440
were my favorite subjects, I always used to

80
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,790
study them and also got good marks in the class.

81
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,310
pass, meaning there was no bad

82
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,840
student, there was no very good student

83
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,200
but I used to pass,

84
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,200
my third and fourth rank in the class was like this, I

85
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,870
never even got second, I only got

86
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:29,040
third, fourth or fifth like this.

87
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,640
and no one has any problem, I used to

88
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,000
study comfortably, what happened once was that

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,670
when I was in 8th class, I used to come from school,

90
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:40,070
my bag was on the bicycle and I used to

91
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,920
park the bicycle and then

92
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,470
eat food.

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,840
means my bag used to remain attached to the same bicycle.

94
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,040
When my father

95
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,990
saw that my bag remained attached to the bicycle for many days, the

96
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,400
bag itself did not come off, then he said

97
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,400
that the bagwa should not be taken off.

98
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,760
period language, in that language

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,950
they said that you don't take off your bag, what do you

100
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,240
mean don't you read? Did I say I read?

101
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,310
Secondly, I mean I have asked for the books of Akash bhaiya and Ashish

102
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:12,040
bhaiya, I

103
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,120
basically read those books of ours.

104
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,560
means cousin, so I used to read his books on

105
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,680
science and maths. He said ok,

106
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,560
no problem, this was the situation, that is, I

107
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,440
was not even touched by school, so

108
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,870
my English was not good in earth class, I basically

109
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:29,640
studied in Hindi medium.

110
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,760
like every Hindi medium student

111
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,160
has, similarly I also had English. Then what

112
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,240
happened was that once it was Republic Day in our school

113
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,120
or I think it must have been 15th August

114
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,560
or 26th January, then a friend in it

115
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,000
said let's go next door.

116
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:48,830
where it is a very good school. Let's

117
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,990
go and see it. So, I went with him to

118
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,920
see it there on 15th August. I found the school

119
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,440
very big, I liked it very much and it

120
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,560
was an English medium school and we

121
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,230
didn't even know about it.

122
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,760
distance of 45 kilometers 34 kilometers from us, so

123
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,400
I told at home that I want to

124
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:07,840
study in an English medium school, then mother talked to father,

125
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,520
then father took me and my sister

126
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,760
on a bicycle and took me there.

127
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,070
And I said that he has already

128
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,720
passed 8th class. I had passed 8th

129
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,680
in Hindi medium. He said

130
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,640
that you should take admission in 8th again

131
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,080
or study again. Then he said

132
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,480
first or second class.

133
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,950
Gave me a science book and said, read this and see what is

134
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,480
written in it. I was

135
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,470
not able to read even a single word of it. Just

136
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:38,430
this is M is this. I was able to read only these words which are of two or three letters. They were

137
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,560
important.

138
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,880
he said that it is not possible for him to get

139
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,240
admission in Hindi English medium,

140
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,120
so I said that he should do it

141
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,160
in the seventh class, he said, it is

142
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,200
not possible, that is, it is not a first class

143
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,520
book.

144
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,840
how will this work be done? They are

145
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,880
not able to read books of first class only, all the

146
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:05,520
children can read easily, so I said,

147
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,800
you take me in seventh class, I will work

148
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,760
very hard, I will study day and night.

149
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,720
learn to read English, he said

150
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,960
no, meaning it is not possible, I said, you

151
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,360
take me in the sixth class, he accepted the

152
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,920
defeat and said, okay, I will take

153
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,910
admission in the sixth class, so I got

154
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,280
admission in the sixth class and I am in

155
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,000
my class.

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,870
I was the first boy in the village to go to an English medium school. When I went there,

157
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,160
all the children, that is, everyone knew English,

158
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,120
everyone could write and

159
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,520
read very easily, no one spoke it, everyone

160
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,960
spoke in Hindi but at least

161
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,240
read less books and used to write. When the teacher

162
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,560
spoke, I used to note it down. I did

163
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,840
not know it, so I worked very

164
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,080
hard, bought a lot of dictionaries and learned a lot.

165
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,480
Gradually, within a year,

166
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:54,560
I became English meaning.

167
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,710
I reached the level where I could read and write, I worked very hard

168
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,590
and then I became at par with all the students. By the time

169
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,360
I was in seventh grade,

170
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,320
my maths, Hindi and other

171
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,160
subjects like science were quite good, so they were

172
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,470
not as good as those people.

173
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,000
studied till A so I already knew all the

174
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,280
things. I could solve Maths very easily.

175
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,200
Hindi was from Hindi medium so

176
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:20,120
Hindi was good and the rest of the subjects

177
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,280
were quite good for me just because of English.

178
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,440
That was also a problem and in one year I had

179
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,070
done English well and had made it at

180
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,400
par with them, then in seventh I worked harder and

181
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,360
got a little better. Then in Earth

182
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:35,000
I did an English course, an English

183
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,960
speaking course, which helped me to improve my English speaking skills.

184
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,630
came to know English well, meaning in a way,

185
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,750
I started writing down whatever I could think in my mind, so

186
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,120
I read Six Seven Eighth twice, once in

187
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,150
Hindi medium, once in English medium

188
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:51,190
and when I was in Earth and then after that

189
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,240
in ninth grade, my father asked me,

190
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,550
'What are you going to become? I had

191
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,000
no idea, I thought becoming a scientist or an

192
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,960
astronaut is what everyone has, it is

193
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,760
a dream. He said that

194
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,240
software engineer is a great job.

195
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,560
You try to

196
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,510
see how one becomes a software engineer and what one has to study.

197
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,480
From there I came to know that there is

198
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,470
something like a software engineer and this is how they came to know

199
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,910
that the one whose car he used to drive was a

200
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,720
driver and the children of those who used to drive his car were

201
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:23,590
software engineers.

202
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,440
he came to know that a software engineer has a

203
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,360
good job and a good salary,

204
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,800
so he said that an engineer's

205
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,080
job is good, try it, you

206
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,320
see, I said, okay, we will see, then

207
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,039
I will be in the ninth.

208
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,030
admission in ninth class. There was no college in the village,

209
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:44,880
no school. Basically, we had to

210
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,480
come to the city. After coming to the city, my

211
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:51,200
father got me admitted in the school and at that time, my

212
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,830
father's salary was Rs. 5000 and my salary was Rs. 5000.

213
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,560
fee was Rs 1500, meaning the school

214
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,640
fee was Rs 00, then when I did coaching,

215
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,400
two and a half rupees were spent on my studies,

216
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
half my salary was spent on my studies

217
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:10,520
and then it was around Rs 12 1 or 14

218
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:13,060
15.

219
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:19,560
so

220
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:19,440
I studied like this in ninth and 10th and

221
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,440
when I finished my 10th by giving exams,

222
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:24,240
my father met with an accident

223
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,840
and was returning home after doing his duty.

224
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,560
about 2 kilometers away from home, he had an

225
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,400
accident with his bike, he was hit by some vehicle

226
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,560
and then he passed by. When

227
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,720
I went there, I

228
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,950
mean, there was no scratch on his body, but

229
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:51,360
his

230
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,800
touching the chest, it felt as if there

231
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:55,880
was a stomach, meaning there were no bones there.

232
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,240
Then they took him to the hospital, there was no use, they

233
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,520
just took him and I was there, meaning I did

234
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,720
n't cry, I couldn't cry.

235
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,120
I cry, what will happen to my mother, my siblings

236
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,240
because at that time I

237
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,870
was the oldest male in my family, my

238
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,200
grandfather had already passed out two-three

239
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,950
years ago and I was the eldest male.

240
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,560
I thought, don't cry, I was feeling like crying

241
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,680
but still I was controlling

242
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:27,640
myself, then I thought

243
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:31,160
what to do now, there is nothing, now I

244
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,680
won't even be able to study, but still my mother told

245
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,030
me.

246
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,640
my father's responsibility, she took

247
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,800
up it. She used to work as an Asha Asha worker and whatever

248
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,920
money she got from doing Hajj, she did

249
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,270
not get more than this, she took care of my education,

250
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,160
household expenses and our farm.

251
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,230
gave it on lease, basically the farm is given on lease like this, we get

252
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,920
some money in a year,

253
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:59,470
203 thousand rupees were earned in a year, so we

254
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:03,080
gave the farm on lease and

255
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,200
father had some money from LIC, which

256
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:08,680
is work.

257
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:12,040
so I went to school in 11th also, the same

258
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:15,040
school, yes but no, I studied 10th,

259
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:18,750
I used to go to school in 11th also and we had a sir,

260
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,390
Rupesh sir, when he came to know that my

261
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,760
father.

262
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,950
math coaching. Earlier too, I used to study from them only.

263
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:29,920
They made my math coaching

264
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:32,440
free, but the school

265
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:35,120
fees were to be paid by the school and I used to

266
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,200
pay the fees for other coachings.

267
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,520
knew this way that if we want to

268
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:42,200
become a software engineer then we will have to do IIT, after

269
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,200
IIT then we will have to do B.Tech, only

270
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,880
after that we can dream of becoming a software engineer,

271
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,840
so basically to

272
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,080
do IIT, Physics and Math are important,

273
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:54,000
very important.

274
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,150
also had interest, I used to study on my own till 10th

275
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,880
and understood everything but

276
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:00,720
when I went to 11th class,

277
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:03,200
I was managing Maths, I was able to understand by

278
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,510
studying on my own and

279
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,670
coaching. What does coaching mean? I was learning it on my own

280
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,760
and I mean, one who studied in coaching,

281
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:14,760
coaching also helped, but I was

282
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:17,120
not able to understand physics on my own.

283
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,800
I got totally troubled in physics.

284
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,800
Physics was one.

285
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,440
very favorite subject was Physics. I

286
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,320
tried hard to study on my own. I

287
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,320
bought different books. I went to different coaching

288
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:35,320
institutes.

289
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,750
I went to all the coaching institutes in our district in Gonda, about three-four.

290
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,560
went to institutes where I

291
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,000
thought that someone or the other would teach Physics

292
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,240
but no one was teaching it properly, that

293
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,120
is, everyone was telling that it will

294
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:53,800
come in your exam and you should focus on it and

295
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,080
it will clear your exam whereas

296
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,040
I had never studied for exams in the beginning

297
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,280
and I could not understand

298
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,430
why we should study for exams, meaning we have to

299
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,710
study to understand, we have to study so

300
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,630
that we can use that thing in our life.

301
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,270
I have tried a lot of things in my life, I

302
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,480
went to a lot of coachings, but I did

303
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,230
not do any workout, no one was able to teach me properly, everyone was

304
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,360
basically teaching me to clear the exams,

305
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:25,040
which was not my motive, the

306
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,080
exam must be cleared.

307
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,240
understood the exam then I

308
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,350
will definitely crack it, I will crack it at 70-80 marks. I

309
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,920
was so confident. Just explain the topic to me. If

310
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,480
no one could explain then my interest

311
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,150
in studies reduced a lot and that was my only

312
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,390
hope.

313
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,270
then become a software engineer and do B.Tech.

314
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,840
All that started to fade away. Gradually, I

315
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,640
lost interest in studies.

316
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,030
Even after wandering in so many coachings, when I did not understand Physics, no

317
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,470
teacher taught me Physics.

318
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:01,280
I was feeling very helpless, I was

319
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:04,840
suddenly broken from within, that is,

320
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,350
I am not able to understand on my own and

321
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,670
no teacher is able to teach me, what should I do now, that is, I

322
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:12,400
suddenly lost my desire to study.

323
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,400
because I was not able to understand what was my favorite subject, so

324
00:14:18,640 --> 00:14:20,280
somehow I gave the 11th exam and till date

325
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,390
I have not seen the result of the exam. Have

326
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,680
I passed or failed in 11th?

327
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,750
Basically who is in 11th?

328
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
might have passed by some marks but I did

329
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:31,270
not see the result. There was a time when it was like this, that is,

330
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,600
at my house, my mother knew,

331
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,560
my siblings, everyone knew that I was not

332
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,160
studying, I was not going to school,

333
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,280
but

334
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,760
not told anything to my neighbors that I was not

335
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,320
studying or completing 12th.

336
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,280
Then when the 12th exam happened, everyone asked how many

337
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,640
marks I got. I said, I got 70 marks.

338
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:52,320
I told everyone that I have passed.

339
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,230
but then I thought that I will do it later, I will tell you whether I will

340
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,710
do it from UP board or any government board, then after that

341
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,440
everyone said that mummy said and those who

342
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,630
knew that I did not do it, those people

343
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,560
Said that do it from any medium,

344
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:14,000
do it from UP board only, then there is

345
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,000
NIOS board, basically like IGNOU,

346
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,630
many people do BCA from IGNOU, then it is open

347
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,360
schooling, similarly there is NIOS board, you have to

348
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,240
fill the form.

349
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:26,120
submit assignments and that is

350
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,680
online, that is, you learn like this, there is

351
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,160
no class, basically distance

352
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:32,360
learning, study on your own and after giving the exam,

353
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,680
I filled the form from that, I did

354
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,480
not increase my studies, that means I did not do any study,

355
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,270
my

356
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,840
understand, I was not able to understand, from where I should

357
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:45,160
study, the same was my favorite subject, I was

358
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,480
not able to understand, what will I do then, what will I do after

359
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,680
studying, so

360
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,440
then I gave the exam for NVS Board.

361
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,160
Gave my 12th exam and this was the first time that

362
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,560
I had failed because I had

363
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,120
not studied anything at all, I just went and gave the exam, the

364
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,680
results of all the subjects except English were

365
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,000
in single digits.

366
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,160
see my 9th and

367
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:10,560
12th result, basically I

368
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,070
failed, I failed miserably in it,

369
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,430
then the head of Anas Board said that

370
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,680
you fill it with Hindi medium.

371
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,830
Children pass, most of the people pass, everyone

372
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,960
passes. I

373
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,670
filled it in Hindi medium. I filled it in Hindi medium from the board itself and

374
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,880
then gave the exam again.

375
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,200
Same situation happened again only

376
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,120
in some subjects like Hindi and English and

377
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,390
Hindi in it.

378
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,720
which the number was in two digits and in Physics

379
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,070
also the number was in two digits and in all the rest again

380
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,120
in single digit and I

381
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,480
failed again. After that I said

382
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,960
leave it, I will not do all this with my school and

383
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,080
coaching.

384
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:49,720
told my mother, "Mummy, buy a laptop

385
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,510
for me, I will learn coding and create apps,

386
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:56,120
I will become an app developer. She

387
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,160
somehow bought a laptop for me. She

388
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,110
collected some money and bought a Dell laptop.

389
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:05,480
So I thought that

390
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,950
It was on August 10, 2016, when I

391
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,240
got my first laptop. I thought that

392
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:12,280
in this we will learn coding, we will create an app.

393
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:14,910
I downloaded And Studio. I came to

394
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,069
know from somewhere that basically a friend of mine

395
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,760
told me that we can learn app development from And Studio.

396
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,510
can do it and my friend was already

397
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,400
doing Diploma in Computer Science,

398
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,240
his name is Faiz, his name is Faiz Ilahi

399
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,840
and today he works with me here in Bangalore,

400
00:17:29,960 --> 00:17:32,670
so he is currently working in my old company.

401
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,520
Said,

402
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,280
install A Studio and we will develop the app. When we

403
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,640
installed it,

404
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,830
its interface was so dangerous, we could not understand anything,

405
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,270
so we thought that we should learn Java language for this. It

406
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,600
was not for Java, so nothing happened, it means we just

407
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,550
installed it.

408
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:06,040
installed, after that no progress was

409
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,280
made, tried for a month and a half, but

410
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,710
what is half a month, tried only for 1015 days

411
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,120
but nothing happened, means no course was

412
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:15,520
found, no proper guidance.

413
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,960
what to learn first and what to do later, so I left it, that

414
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:20,670
too means I uninstalled End Studio

415
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,400
and downloaded A49 game in it,

416
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,760
I used to sit there and play the whole day and

417
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,120
then later the same

418
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,480
friend Faiz himself told me that

419
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,790
Learn C language. At least if you learn C language

420
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,960
then basically it is basic fundamental.

421
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,040
Whatever is the language of a language, everything

422
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,600
starts from C, so he

423
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,720
recommended Saurabh Shukla sir's channel, so

424
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,200
I started watching it, I liked it a lot and

425
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,280
understood programming.

426
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:58,830
understanding conditional false loops and arrays and all the things, so I learned C from them, I

427
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:02,080
also learned c+ps and also solved questions which are

428
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:04,320
questions in DSA type. It was in

429
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,000
2018 when I learned c+ps.

430
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,320
In 2017, I basically played S-Foot

431
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,520
and taught coaching to children and I

432
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,790
worked on my English. I thought that if

433
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,080
nothing else, I would at least improve my English. I used to

434
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,800
watch English videos and

435
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:21,200
listen to English podcasts, so I

436
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:24,640
improved my English.

437
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,670
I taught coaching to children and used the laptop only to

438
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,720
play games and

439
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,160
learned the same C again for about a year, after learning C again and

440
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,360
solving the questions, I did not understand

441
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,240
what to do now, that is,

442
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,840
done it, I am also solving the questions,

443
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,080
but will it work? I did not understand anything from this,

444
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,790
then I thought that let's learn web development. It is the

445
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,400
beginning of 2019. I

446
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,240
downloaded some videos. I thought that let's try and

447
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:06,400
see.

448
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,310
basically one by one tag, they said that

449
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,360
you have to remember this, they were teaching in notepad, they

450
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:14,070
said that this is the opening tag, this is the closing tag,

451
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,190
in this, you have to put an exclamation

452
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,680
mark, a slash here and there, then you have to

453
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,320
put angular brackets, after seeing that I said.

454
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,550
Web development is better than C language

455
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:26,000
or web development is the worst thing, I

456
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,800
got this perception after seeing it, I

457
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,400
said, this is just a rote thing, there

458
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,560
is nothing useful in it, otherwise

459
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:33,960
I left it, I said

460
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:35,840
not learn development no matter what happens.

461
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,880
It was in 2018 when I

462
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,000
tried web development for the first time and I

463
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,240
lost confidence in it. I thought what to do, you

464
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,600
can't even do development because it

465
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,080
is difficult, there is no one to teach and at that

466
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,760
time.

467
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,320
videos, all the things were very rare at that time, so

468
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,560
I thought what to

469
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,360
do now, I can't even do web development, I ca

470
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,440
n't even do development, what will I do using C, that

471
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:02,790
means I won't be able to create anything.

472
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,800
some questions but

473
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,960
now I don't feel like solving how much, I do

474
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,150
n't have that much motivation and then I

475
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,240
thought let's go home, there is no point in staying here in the city and

476
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,480
spending money unnecessarily, we will

477
00:21:13,640 --> 00:21:16,200
go home and do farming and

478
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:19,200
rest.

479
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:22,000
no problem, all my dreams were shattered, I came home, I

480
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,160
told my mother that I will not do anything now, I will

481
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,920
stay at home, I will just wait and see, whatever

482
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,520
happens, will happen, there was no hope left that if

483
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,430
anything would happen then I

484
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,080
thought that we will open a shop and the

485
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,440
expenses will keep on running. I had thought to such an extent

486
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,790
that now we will do only a shop that

487
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:42,120
I went beyond the shop of cement and morang sand and

488
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,600
went to that shop.

489
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,760
shop there, that day the

490
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,600
man was not there, that means the shop was closed and there

491
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,790
was only one shop in that area which

492
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,400
was nearby, so I returned, I thought

493
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,440
no problem, we will go the next day.

494
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:04,360
mood changed, I thought that they do not

495
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,400
do shop, they do some farming, they do farming only a little, they do farming

496
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:09,000
well, something will happen from farming, they

497
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,670
will do some work in farming, so I used to do

498
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,800
farming, but did

499
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,560
not do it on a very big level.

500
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,270
graze the cow, it was our cow, go and

501
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,120
graze the cow, do farming, cut the wheat, harvest the paddy,

502
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,760
bring it back, a few

503
00:22:25,960 --> 00:22:27,600
laborers used to work, we also did a little

504
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:32,240
along with us, so this continued and then hope was

505
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,600
lost.

506
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,400
in software, there was no hope

507
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,440
that I would be able to do something like this, then I got

508
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
interested in spirituality,

509
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,120
how to control my mind,

510
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,680
how to keep my mind working, although my mind was

511
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,710
already

512
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,920
I didn't get too angry, but even more so, I did

513
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,000
n't care about what others said

514
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,320
because when I was not doing anything,

515
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,400
people started asking, "Brother, what are you doing, what are you going to do, whether you want to do

516
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,830
something or not."

517
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,520
know that he has not even

518
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,520
completed 12th, he has wasted two years and has come here and has taken a

519
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,840
laptop, has taken a mobile,

520
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,840
everyone is getting spoiled, it means

521
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,320
everyone is getting spoiled by having a mobile, and what do

522
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:21,070
people do?

523
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,280
not, do something, then basically they

524
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:28,030
also wanted to do something and started saying meaning,

525
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,120
when you don't do anything, sit at home the

526
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,640
whole day, do some outside work, stay at home the

527
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,400
whole day.

528
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,880
watch things related to spirituality. I met

529
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,790
Sadhguru. I liked and understood Sadhguru's words. I

530
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,000
watched all his videos at one time

531
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,630
and by watching those videos, I got the benefit that

532
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:53,990
I

533
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,840
a great extent. Basically, no matter what anyone

534
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,480
says from outside, it did not make much difference to me.

535
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,440
Earlier too, I did

536
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,000
not get angry, but

537
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,280
now after listening to Sadhguru, it made a difference to

538
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:11,640
me.

539
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,280
control, my mind started working,

540
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,910
everything was working, it means I started being happy but I was

541
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,230
not doing anything, so there was a wholeness inside, there

542
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,840


543
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:28,470
was not an amnesiac, but there was a K inside which was

544
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,640
saying that

545
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,480
doing, you will die like this, they came like this

546
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,790
and when I started sitting at home,

547
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,200
one of my acquaintance's brother said that

548
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:41,560
we have a copper bottle factory, you

549
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,040
pick up the copper bottles from here, we will sell it to you.

550
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:46,480
give you bottles for ₹ and you sell them at the shop for Rs 250-300, this will make

551
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,760
you some

552
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,960
profit and you will earn something, so I

553
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,880
started doing this, I bought

554
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,670
bottles from them and I took them on a bicycle and used to go from

555
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,400
shop to shop and sell bottles for Rs

556
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,680
250.

557
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,480
asked me to give him 10 bottles,

558
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,880
I will give you some money now and

559
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:10,840
when all the bottles are sold, I will give you the

560
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,280
money. He gave me Rs. 000,

561
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,720
I also agreed that means I

562
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,470
believed that he will give me the money, it will run away somewhere, he has a

563
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:20,400
whole shop right here in

564
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,360
our city, so he gave me

565
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:26,240
Rs. 000, then he said that

566
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:28,720
we will give him the money after a month, but after a month,

567
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,910
when I asked,

568
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,350
bottles are not being sold, that is, they are being

569
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,520
sold at very low prices, no one is buying them.

570
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,480
I told him, ok,

571
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,000
give me the money for whatever is sold. He gave me

572
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:42,480
₹ 5000000 for

573
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,960
two-three bottles with him.

574
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,150
returned it and said that brother, that's all

575
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,270
and nothing else would be possible, so the business he had started from there too, which

576
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,040
was a small selling business,

577
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,160
also lost confidence after this incident.

578
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:02,680
I also stopped selling the bottles

579
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,560
because there was no interest and I

580
00:26:04,680 --> 00:26:06,960
also got cheated, so I said that

581
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,390
I will not be able to commit to selling, I will do farming, I will

582
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,960
live a simple life, I don't want to get into the trap of all this.

583
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,040
Almost everyone said something or the other.

584
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:17,080
Do something, why are you sitting idle, do some

585
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:20,320
work, get some job done, do something,

586
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,760
relatives also said, neighbors also

587
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,030
said, everyone said but my mother did

588
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:27,120
not say do something, she said

589
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,790
do whatever you like and we will do it.

590
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:32,520
take whatever we want, whatever we have to earn, we will

591
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,640
do it, you sit comfortably, study,

592
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,920
do whatever you like,

593
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,120
then he basically knew the meaning behind the

594
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,950
scenes, meaning I am not doing anything wrong,

595
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,240
watch some picture or movie.

596
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,040
working on myself, I was doing well in English, I would do

597
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,440
something one day, so he had

598
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:51,200
faith in me that I would do something, that is

599
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,360
why he never asked me to

600
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,120
do any job or to work or to study.

601
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,000
My mother did not force me to do anything, except her, that is, except

602
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,000
my family,

603
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:07,880
everyone else told me to do something, do something, so my

604
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:11,520
aunt has a school, a school till 10th, a

605
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,600
school from first to 10th.

606
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,750
Our aunt's son has a school there, basically he said I have to

607
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,560
teach in the school, I

608
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,150
said first I don't want to

609
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,800
teach, then he said teach, meaning

610
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,360
he knew that I teach well,

611
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,790
basically Ashish bhaiya, his name is Ashish.

612
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,520
Bhaiya said, he knew that I

613
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,760
teach well, I have also taught coaching,

614
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,040
so he said, try teaching, come and

615
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,270
see how you like it, then later, if you

616
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,440
don't feel like teaching, then don't teach, just try.

617
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,390
Then he said.

618
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,080
started teaching there, it felt right, I taught

619
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,640
there for a year, I taught

620
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:51,710
science and maths to children from six to 10, I used to

621
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,680
teach English also,

622
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:55,040
sometimes if the English teacher did not come,

623
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,480
but my main subject was

624
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,550
was science and maths, but even when I was teaching, there was that

625
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:02,070
emptiness inside that something has to be done,

626
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,120
something should be done, that emptiness was always there,

627
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,520
meaning it did not feel that we have to live our entire

628
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,150
life like this, this is our life, this is

629
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:13,190
our job.

630
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,080
felt that something was missing and something should be done.

631
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,680
Meanwhile, when I was teaching in school,

632
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:19,430
I met my wife through social media. At

633
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520
that time, I did not have a wife, but today,

634
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:24,200
she is a wife and

635
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,200
felt good to meet him, the mind set was

636
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,040
quite similar, interest in spirituality, interest in

637
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:31,440
maths, interest in science, interest in

638
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,480
physics, all these interests were similar,

639
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:38,000
meaning same and many other things were similar, goal was to

640
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,080
do something good, meaning in a

641
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:44,550
way, it meant me.

642
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,750
in the female version, it was ok, I felt that we started

643
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,840
talking and I liked it a lot and

644
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,400
then he pushed me to do something,

645
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:57,520
so he showed me the opportunity that

646
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,600
many things

647
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,840
can be done through the internet.

648
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,680
Many people do jobs on the internet. Earlier, I did

649
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,960
not think that I could

650
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:09,990
get something through the internet. Although I used to use the internet, I did

651
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,150
not think that much about the job,

652
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,680
so my only conventional method

653
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,840
was

654
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:20,790
get a job from there, so I knew this path,

655
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,910
he said that no, there are other things,

656
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,280
so I thought what to do now, so I

657
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,360
thought, let's do 3D

658
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,920
modeling, so I did it because he

659
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:33,000
is my brother.

660
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,990
Adarsh. He was already doing 3D modeling. I had introduced him to 3D modeling.

661
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:40,640
I had also taught him coding for 3D modeling.

662
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:43,360
When I did not know it,

663
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,080
I had provided him tutorials.

664
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,280
He had also learned it but he also had

665
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,080
was no guidance as to what to do next, how to

666
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,600
get a job in it or some of the

667
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,200
things she knew but she knew coding, C language,

668
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,000
Python, she knew all these things but she also did

669
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,680
not know what to do next and

670
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:02,670
ended by solving only that many questions.

671
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,880
modeling and making models, so

672
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,120
I thought, let's do 3D modeling, it will bring

673
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,560
something, that is, I will

674
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,080
do some freelancing online on Upwork, on Fiber,

675
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,720
I learned a little bit of freelancing,

676
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,360
not much, just not freelancing,

677
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,680
basically did not learn much of 3D modeling.

678
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,440
created an account on Upwork

679
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,600
that I am a freelance

680
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:30,760
3D designer, I make 3D models,

681
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,840
so we got a client from the US, we got a

682
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:36,430
client, he got the design of a car

683
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,600
made, the design of the car must be lying somewhere,

684
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:41,120
if you can find the link of it.

685
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,480
was YouTube1 but I thought

686
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,200
how long will this work continue, I learn it myself, so

687
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,630
my brother completed the first project,

688
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,440
I used to just talk

689
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:05,470
in between that I have to do this, he completed the entire

690
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,200
project and

691
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,520
dollars, more than 100, 100, 50 dollars

692
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:12,120
and the first income was through online,

693
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,560
so I did not do everything in it,

694
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,390
I just talked, then after that

695
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,040
I learned D myself and made models by myself.

696
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,480
But I was not enjoying it, I was

697
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,520
not feeling any meaning in it that this is not what I am doing, this is

698
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:31,310
our life, we will spend it in this only and that too

699
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:33,480
means I made models again, one ad,

700
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,000
maybe one for the same client, one freelancing for some other client

701
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,310
and so on.

702
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:43,360
but I earned the same 100 50 00 through that

703
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,800
but I did

704
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,760
not get any feeling in it either, it did not feel very right, still

705
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,120
I used to learn 3D modeling from

706
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:53,640
youtube0 modeling, so one day I was

707
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,270
watching a video of 3D modeling.

708
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,600
ad coming, that ad was of a web development course

709
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,560
and in that ad a lady was speaking, she was

710
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,720
saying something and I liked her way of speaking

711
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,880
that how we will

712
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,200
learn, how each and every thing was covered.

713
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,640
Within this course, I thought that let's try

714
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,320
web development once again,

715
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,390
I purchased that course and the

716
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,320
price of that course was only ₹ 5000000

717
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,640
and this day was the turning point of my life,

718
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,550
from then on there was no looking back, it was so good.

719
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:31,470
He taught me web development, it was very easy to

720
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,560
understand, beginner friendly, he explained everything very well and

721
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,760
after that my life

722
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,360
changed completely, I started understanding every concept of web development, I got

723
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,720
interested.

724
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,360
HTML, CSS,

725
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,440
JavaScript, React and whatever he

726
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,510
covered in the notes, so I followed all the things

727
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,240
and I

728
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,790
practiced a lot of CSS, my CSS

729
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,000
became very good, I started creating responses very easily

730
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:03,040
and

731
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:05,480
taught me, it was very basic and

732
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,120
I tried to learn CSS well,

733
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,360
after that I made many projects using CSS,

734
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,520
basically

735
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,960
in the beginning I focused on CSS only,

736
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,800
many projects of CSS.

737
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,200
projects on my own, he

738
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,790
said do you know CSS, I said

739
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,630
yes, he said if you give me some design then you will make it, he

740
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:03,880
sent the design, I said

741
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,680
yes, we will make it, he said,

742
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,159
how much will you charge for making a design, then

743
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,590
I said, I have it in my mind.

744
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,719
make such projects every day,

745
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:15,909
I can do this for free but if they are

746
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,469
asking then they will say something, then I

747
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:20,159
said, I will take 5500, I said, ok, ok, do it,

748
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:22,760
they sent it to me,

749
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,389
what project do I want to make?

750
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,110
was nothing much, just a few cards, the

751
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,920
design was a bit complicated, that is why he knew

752
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,440
little CSS, that is why he took my help, so I did

753
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,000
that and gave it to him

754
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,639
and he gave me another project,

755
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,909
then I did both the projects.

756
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:39,880
Both were simple projects, I did the

757
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,400
project in about two to four days

758
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,150
and they gave me Rs. 000 because there was

759
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:47,830
talk of Rs. 50000 for one project, they gave me Rs. 1000 and

760
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,159
I earned Rs. 000 in four days. This is

761
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,000
my first freelancing project.

762
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,800
That I did not reach out, it was

763
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,120
they who did the reach out. It was

764
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,520
Instagram's freelancing project, so

765
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:17,400
I thought, okay, I am starting to get the hang of

766
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:20,320
freelancing, so I am in all the

767
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,080
social media groups, the

768
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,440
Discord groups of the tubers.

769
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:31,240
then in some discord, someone

770
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,120
messaged that is there any front end developer, is

771
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,920
he needed? So I said, I

772
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:39,400
messaged him that yes, I know, so

773
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:40,720
he hired me, that is,

774
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:44,080
he gave me some

775
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:46,240
projects.

776
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,030
earned Rs 56000. There were not many big projects, there

777
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,200
were only small projects, so

778
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:55,040
there I got Rs 000 from him and then

779
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,040
one more and one more. Basically,

780
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:02,320
I did a project for a startup and

781
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:05,280
got Rs 4,000 for that too.

782
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:07,680
from web development, I thought let's

783
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,920
go to Bangalore, I got a little confidence

784
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:13,160
that I am getting some money from this and

785
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,480
I am also feeling good, so the confidence came,

786
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,240
let's go to Bangalore and I will get a job there.

787
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,760
got something then I came, meaning there

788
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,120
was no job now, I just came like this, did one or two

789
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,080
freelancing projects and then came

790
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:31,110
here, I started applying for internships,

791
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:33,000
I thought I

792
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:35,880
would get only internships, what else can I get with so much knowledge?

793
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,430
I applied for internship at many places and got a

794
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,720
call from many places. Basically,

795
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,760
I got a call from one place. They said that we have an

796
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:44,680
opening for internship but we

797
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:46,120
need a freelancer. If you

798
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,440
do freelancing then you can work for us.

799
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:52,880
Basically he did not have any team, it was more of a

800
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,240
project, he had got it done

801
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,040
from a developer, the project was fine but he was

802
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,880


803
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,800
well versed in responsiveness, I knew the lead well, I had

804
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,880
prepared a lot of responses, he

805
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,800
said yes, I will do it, so I

806
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,550
asked him.

807
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:18,150
I said, I will take Rs. 500 for an hour, meaning Rs.

808
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,520
500 for an hour. I said no, this is too much.

809
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:25,110
He said that we can give Rs. 00. I was

810
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,030
thinking in my mind that Rs. 00 for an hour is quite

811
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,830
good, it means I did Rs. 500 for an hour a day.

812
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:36,560
they said that we

813
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:39,350
can give Rs. 200. I said that it is okay, I will do the

814
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,990
work, it doesn't matter that you are speaking for the first time,

815
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:44,760
I will do it. I was happy from inside, so I

816
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:48,760
decided on another hour.

817
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:50,440
started working on their website,

818
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,720
although I had come to Bangalore, there was no job at that time, it

819
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:55,520
was only freelancing work, so

820
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:59,430
I worked for about 28 or 20 25 days for a month,

821
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,150
25 to 28 days, I worked on it

822
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,120
and

823
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:09,120
was a good payment, that is, I had worked for more than 100 hours, so when they paid me around

824
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,480
Rs. 0000, it

825
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,720
felt even better. I felt

826
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,350
confident that this is the work of my choice,

827
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,560
which I can do for free, and

828
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,320
get paid for it.

829
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,960
freelancing project was over now,

830
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,040
now I started applying for internship again

831
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,720
and I applied to many places at

832
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,800
least 20 times a day,

833
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:33,400
then I started getting calls.

834
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,360
my interview was scheduled. In the interview,

835
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:38,160
they asked something like JavaScript, Single

836
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,200
Threaded, Multi Threaded. Well,

837
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,680
I had not studied it, it was

838
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,160
not mentioned in the course. Angela said, "

839
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,440
What is this, okay?" She said, "I have

840
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:51,400
said, I guess I had heard about single threaded

841
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:55,080
somewhere in some video, so I said,

842
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,400
what does it mean when I say single threaded?

843
00:38:57,520 --> 00:38:59,630
I said, now I have to explain its meaning also,

844
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,560
I said, I don't know all this, then

845
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,120
asked one or two more questions.

846
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,920
core concepts of JavaScript, so I did

847
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,160
n't know anything. I said, "Hey,

848
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:12,160
what have you read? I have followed the entire course

849
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,830
from you, Angela, so I don't know it at all,

850
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:15,840
then I have

851
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,320
come to Realix S. I

852
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,280
don't know JavaScript, just a little."

853
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,480
ifs for loops and functions but I do

854
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,630
n't know JavaScript well. So what should I

855
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,360
do now? Then I purchased their Colt

856
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,920
Steel course.

857
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:57,880
I saw only the JavaScript section

858
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,720
and their JavaScript was quite good

859
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,840
Anjala.

860
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:04,990
JavaScript was much more detailed, it was bigger

861
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,800
and they explained it a little better, so

862
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:11,000
from there I got a little

863
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:14,040
better knowledge of JavaScript, I

864
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,960
understood it more completely, the whole whole picture was understood, the fundamental

865
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:18,360
concepts were clear, but still I was not ready for

866
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,590
the interviews.

867
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,720
I was getting stuck in JavaScript. People were

868
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,440
asking closures, hidden functions

869
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:28,040
and scopes, meaning how does lexic

870
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,070
scope work, what is all this, synchronous,

871
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:32,880
how is synchronous code running,

872
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:35,270
call backs.

873
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,160
interns ask. Okay, it was still

874
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:43,560
not happening, so when I was following Cold Steel

875
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:45,080
in JavaScript course,

876
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,840
here when I came to Bangalore,

877
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,870
a friend of mine became a person.

878
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,720
settled here in Bangalore.

879
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,320
He is also working today. His name is

880
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,440
Gautam, so he is also working in front end.

881
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:00,280
When we met, we were learning together,

882
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,960
so I used to help him.

883
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,120
He helped me to settle down in Bangalore.

884
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:09,200
He is from Bangalore and he

885
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:12,160
sent me a course called Namaste JavaScript by Akshay Saini. At

886
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:15,000
that time I

887
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,480
was not ready to watch that course. I saw

888
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,760
that he was teaching something.

889
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,960
going on top that at that time I had

890
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,840
studied Anjala U and I was not able to understand

891
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,280
what they were teaching, everyone was

892
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,600
teaching useless things, I said this is a bad course,

893
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,240
it is not a very good course, so I

894
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,960
n't even see it, then I

895
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,440
read JavaScript from Colt Steel. When my

896
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,880
JavaScript became good, then I

897
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:41,630
saw it again. When I saw it again, my eyes opened. Suddenly

898
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,400
JavaScript seemed cool. I

899
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,840
understood everything. He wrote it very

900
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,240
well. Akshay.

901
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,840
very well in the Namaste JavaScript series,

902
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,760
how JavaScript works behind the scenes. I started

903
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,560
understanding everything

904
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:58,360
and I thought

905
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:02,760
that it means do some other advanced courses too,

906
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,440
I have done

907
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,880
YouTube's but in that advanced course

908
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,390
also.

909
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:12,520
taught, Namaste, the

910
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,960
same things were there in JavaScript too, so

911
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:16,680
basically I understood it twice and it was repeated,

912
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:19,000
so whatever advanced concepts were behind the

913
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:19,960
scenes, how JavaScript works,

914
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:22,000
because of Akshay Saini and

915
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,080
because of JavaScript, my JavaScript became

916
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:26,790
very good. I started understanding JavaScript on my own by digging into

917
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,950
their dev tools more than what they taught me. They

918
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:34,000
explained me

919
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,080
how to use the dev tools, so effectively,

920
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:39,030
after that I learned it on my own.

921
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:42,200
exploring on my own, understood JavaScript in depth,

922
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:47,240
after that my interview started

923
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,470
going well and I got selected in a startup. If

924
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:54,680
yes, then how was the selection,

925
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:57,040
I also tell you in my resume

926
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,830
what is my education.

927
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,480
not there, so in one of the sections at the bottom,

928
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,320
I had mentioned that

929
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,160
under education, I had seen some courses like Self-Tut, UD and Coursera, but

930
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:10,920
from Coursera,

931
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,960
although I had seen some courses not of web development but of Ed,

932
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,880
sometimes that's it.

933
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:20,160
Self Tut UD course, that's all I had

934
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:22,240
mentioned, Free Quote Cam was also probably mentioned, I do

935
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,480
n't remember, this is what I had mentioned,

936
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,550
so when the interviewers used to call, it was

937
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:30,600
pickle call or interviewer's

938
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:32,840
call.

939
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,310
that when did you do graduation and

940
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,360
in which field, I used to say that

941
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,800
I have not done graduation,

942
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:45,440
I learned coding after 10th and I was interested in it,

943
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,240
so I did it after 10th.

944
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:48,800
doing web development and freelancing

945
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,440
and these are some of my freelancing

946
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:52,720
projects which I have done

947
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:54,200
inside the resume. Inside the resume, I had done my

948
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,280
original freelancing projects

949
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:59,040
which were two-three projects, they

950
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,760
were all projects and one

951
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:02,600
projects were just one or two such personal

952
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,040
projects, so in the resume also,

953
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,040
I had also made a portfolio, that

954
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:09,280
portfolio is quite good, it is still there, I will

955
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,830
give its link in the description, if you

956
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:14,240
go and see it, then I have made one named Anug sbm.com.

957
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,360
domain and on top of that I had

958
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:19,960
hosted my portfolio, on top of that

959
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,760
I had

960
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:24,270
kept whatever freelancing projects I had, so I had told

961
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,920
that I mean I used to tell the interviewer that

962
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:30,040
I learned web development after 10th and learned

963
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:32,800
coding.

964
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:35,110
okay, I am freelancing, these are

965
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:37,320
some of my projects, okay, so they used to

966
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,520
say, okay, no problem, skill matters to us,

967
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,080
degree does not matter that much,

968
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:46,000
and to my surprise,

969
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,870
I got about 20 interviewers.

970
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,480
which only one said that

971
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:55,550
we want a B.Tech person, sorry we can't proceed with you, it's

972
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,760
okay, the one with degree,

973
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:00,920
then after listening to all the others said that

974
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,680
skill matters to us, degree does

975
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:06,590
n't matter to us.

976
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,630
n't know if this happens to everyone,

977
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:12,440
otherwise I feel that my

978
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,000
projects and my freelancing

979
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:16,560
work were good, my portfolio

980
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:19,510
was good, that's what people were saying after seeing it.

981
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,560
That it is working well, so it does

982
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:24,560
n't matter, the degree doesn't matter, if

983
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:25,400
you just go straight like this, we will speak, we know

984
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,520
nothing just by speaking, you have to show the

985
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,760
work, so it may not happen with you.

986
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:35,880
If your portfolio is strong,

987
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,920
your resume is strong, the projects are

988
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:40,400
good and if there are freelancing

989
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:42,000
projects then there are more chances of

990
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,320
your getting selected, so

991
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,440
I think that is why he was saying

992
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,270
that this guy knows, he has done the work.

993
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,200
we don't care about degree, we care

994
00:45:52,520 --> 00:45:54,280
about skill and if you know it then you will be

995
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:57,000
selected. If you give interview

996
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:00,120
then interview was scheduled and I

997
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,640
gave many interviews and got selected at some two or three places

998
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,440
and there was a company whose name was

999
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,040
Digit.

1000
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:10,720
interview and I performed very well,

1001
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:13,720
I answered about 80-90 questions, mainly it was on

1002
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:15,840
JavaScript, there were

1003
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,840
a few questions, so

1004
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,040
I answered

1005
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,720
and I got selected there. Okay, I

1006
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,310
also got marks in the company.

1007
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:27,520
but I found Digit to be a very good company,

1008
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:29,880
their brand ambassador was Virat Kohli, so it was

1009
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,830
nice to see him and it was a big

1010
00:46:34,080 --> 00:46:36,080
company, it had a good product base,

1011
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:39,800
so I decided to join there

1012
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,000
and that was my first company.

1013
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,600
I am very thankful to the first interviewer who got selected

1014
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,280
because he

1015
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:51,720
valued my skills and he

1016
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:54,640
gave me a chance. I joined Digit Insurance on 22 July 2021

1017
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,480
and my

1018
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,560
position there was Software Engineer

1019
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,400
and when I got this position, I was

1020
00:47:04,440 --> 00:47:06,640
was no limit to my happiness after that as my father had said that

1021
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,360
I had become a software engineer and

1022
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:14,880
people who were coming after doing B.Tech, M.Tech or BC MCA were

1023
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,830
sitting next to me.

1024
00:47:17,480 --> 00:47:19,830
and there was no difference in salary wise, the

1025
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:21,920
salary was the same as theirs, mine was the same,

1026
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:25,080
respect is the same, everything is there and

1027
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,880
people were respecting me a little more

1028
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:28,920
because I had learned it myself.

1029
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,240
Everyone there knew that this guy is self-

1030
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,760
taught, he has studied only after 10th, so

1031
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,550
my experience inside Digit was very good, there was a

1032
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:37,720
very good team, there was a very friendly team, there were

1033
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:39,920
very good and supportive managers, I

1034
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,040
never got any help from anyone inside Digit.

1035
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,600
not have to face anything like politics, I used to do my work.

1036
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:47,480
Within my job, I worked only on

1037
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:50,040
HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which means

1038
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,240
basically I mainly worked on CSS and JavaScript. For

1039
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,640
2 years, I

1040
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,840
worked only on CSS and JavaScript.

1041
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,080
Because of this, my JavaScript and

1042
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:01,360
CSS became stronger and the core

1043
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,400
technologies became stronger and I knew

1044
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,720
my work so well.

1045
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,400
I knew JavaScript CS

1046
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:09,840
so well that in two years

1047
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,870
worked and never needed help from any senior.

1048
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:14,320
Whatever problem came,

1049
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,280
I used to figure it out on my own.

1050
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,920
Whatever, if there is any back end

1051
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:20,440
problem, any other technology problem, with

1052
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,240
whom.

1053
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:25,480
I need to take help from others.

1054
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,000
I did not need to take help from anyone for my work. So

1055
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:30,120
if your fundamental

1056
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:33,360
concept is clear then

1057
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:35,110
you can solve the problem on your own.

1058
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,480
know what the problem is, then when

1059
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:40,720
you remain like this, you have

1060
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,600
a respect within the company, you are a good person,

1061
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:46,600
people come and ask you, people used to

1062
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:47,680
think that I have a lot of

1063
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,190
experience, so whatever there is

1064
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:51,550
ask me, if there is any

1065
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:54,320
problem with JavaScript, they used to ask me only,

1066
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,200
even though I am doing it for the first time, I

1067
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,000
am less junior than them, which means I have

1068
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,360
less experience than them, still they used to

1069
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:04,230
come and ask me and I was like them.

1070
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:05,920
because my fundamental

1071
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:07,520
concepts were clear, my CSS and

1072
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:10,320
JavaScript were clear, that is why I did

1073
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:12,440
not face any problem in two years

1074
00:49:12,840 --> 00:49:15,040
because my work was always clean, I used to complete my

1075
00:49:15,640 --> 00:49:17,280
entire work in four-five hours,

1076
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:19,760
after that

1077
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,000
then after 5:00 pm I started

1078
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,840
playing table tennis.

1079
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,910
After 5:30 pm I used to go to play TT and for one year

1080
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,600
we played a lot of TT, meaning two, two, three-

1081
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,310
hours means I played a lot of TT and my TT had also become

1082
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:35,840
very good and

1083
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:37,870
no one has any problem because my work is always ready, that is,

1084
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:40,200
whatever work is given,

1085
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:42,680
I keep it working, so when you

1086
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:44,280
know things well.

1087
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:47,280
your work gets done very fast, you are

1088
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:48,950
not stuck anywhere, if you face any problem, you will come to

1089
00:49:49,160 --> 00:49:50,830
know that it is a problem, it is

1090
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,560
very rare, I don't even remember

1091
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:55,160
that I ever got stuck

1092
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:57,760
on any problem.

1093
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,880
problem gets solved immediately. You should know how to

1094
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:03,160
use Google3 well,

1095
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:05,920
so now Chat GPT has come, earlier

1096
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,320
Chat GPT was not there, the only

1097
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:27,720
thing I missed is that this is my first

1098
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,350
youtube in 1 or 18.

1099
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:40,040
or 20, I had started teaching Math on

1100
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:54,760
YouTube1. I had

1101
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:58,840
tried making a chain once before, so this is

1102
00:50:58,960 --> 00:50:59,680
not my first time. After

1103
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:02,800
making three videos on YouTube2, I

1104
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:04,790
lost my motivation and stopped it because

1105
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,520
in

1106
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,070
meaning I had not done anything myself, what would

1107
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,360
I teach to others, so that

1108
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,760
confidence was not coming from within, even though

1109
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,760
I knew the topics, I knew maths,

1110
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,830
but there was a hollow feeling from within.

1111
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:21,600
youtube4 was not closed at that time, my

1112
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:27,280
youtube2 was closed after uploading three videos,

1113
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,030
so then I mean it was always in my mind

1114
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:31,760
that on

1115
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,640
youtube4, on September 2022, I

1116
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,040
uploaded the first video and then on September 10,

1117
00:51:57,080 --> 00:52:00,360
2000 22, I uploaded my first video.

1118
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:04,200
and started teaching,

1119
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,440
I covered everything very well, whatever

1120
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:09,310
I knew, I had one year of company

1121
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:13,960
experience,

1122
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:13,590
I learned all the things from different courses, I studied

1123
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:16,240
CSS, taught JavaScript and

1124
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:19,550
Then in between everything was going well and it was

1125
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:22,400
growing normally at its own pace. Then

1126
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,320
in between we got married. If you will

1127
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,880
see some videos of JavaScript set

1128
00:52:27,080 --> 00:52:29,750
time out and in the videos of that particular time,

1129
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,790
then you will see in my hand.

1130
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,150
seen wearing mehendi, then at that time, in the middle of the time, when the

1131
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,760
JavaScript project i.e. videos were

1132
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,600
going on, the playlist was going on, then

1133
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,640
in the middle, we got married and we got settled here in

1134
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:47,560
Bangalore and then everything was going well on

1135
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,600
youtube0.

1136
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,880
almost 2023, it was 2023, that

1137
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:59,430
means two years were about to go inside Digit and

1138
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,280
I was starting to find some work boring, which was

1139
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:04,040
office work because it was the same HTML, CSS

1140
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:06,480
and JavaScript, on top of that

1141
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,590
I was

1142
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,600
meaning there was not much new left,

1143
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,870
almost the same work was to be done every day, there was

1144
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,720
no React in my company, which was a digital

1145
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,680
insurance company, Angular was used there,

1146
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,880
so I said that Angular was used.

1147
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:23,920
Give us some projects, we will learn Angular, so

1148
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:27,200
I learned Angular,

1149
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,200
after learning Angular, I took some Angular projects.

1150
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:32,800
What does project mean, small features, feature

1151
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:34,920
additions, bugs, all this,

1152
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:39,160
I did two or three things, but still

1153
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,240
I have to do regular projects with Angular.

1154
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,880
I was mainly getting only CSS and

1155
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:45,440
JavaScript projects for

1156
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:48,240
which I had worked for two years and it was

1157
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:52,120
starting to get a bit boring. Now I mean,

1158
00:53:52,320 --> 00:53:53,720
Angular projects were not found there, so

1159
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,840
I thought let's try somewhere else.

1160
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,360
good if I find it somewhere, where

1161
00:53:59,640 --> 00:54:00,920
I can work in React because

1162
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:03,240
React was my favorite framework and I had

1163
00:54:03,360 --> 00:54:05,040
learned React well,

1164
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,560
so I created my profile on Well Found, whose name

1165
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:11,960
was earlier Angel List, and that's it,

1166
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,120
I shared my

1167
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,670
experience.

1168
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:21,000
Well Found and then from there I got a

1169
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:24,590
message from there itself asking, are

1170
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,440
you available for the job, is it open?

1171
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,240
So I said yes, I am open

1172
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,550
and there in my report also.

1173
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,190
also got the resume from there, so basically

1174
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,520
it was a UK based company, from there a

1175
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,240
UK guy had reached out to me,

1176
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,880
so I said yes, I am available,

1177
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:48,720
he said notice period, you mentioned 30 days

1178
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:50,840
in your resume.

1179
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,990
period is 30 days, I said no, it

1180
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,030
is 30 days, not three months, they said,

1181
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,480
then why did you mention 30 days,

1182
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,310
I said, then the call will not come, if you mention 90

1183
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,280
days, you will mention three months, then the call will

1184
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,440
not come at all, you reach.

1185
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:05,160
so I mentioned it like this and he

1186
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,110
started laughing and said, ok, no problem, let's

1187
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:07,960
do your interview, we will

1188
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:11,680
see you later, we will wait

1189
00:55:11,800 --> 00:55:14,520
or whatever happens, it will be seen, then he

1190
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:15,960
scheduled the interview.

1191
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:20,680
-Different

1192
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:20,190
round was conducted, questions were asked very well, questions were

1193
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:23,080
taken in depth, I

1194
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:25,160
liked the interview very much, I also performed well,

1195
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,400
I answered 90 questions

1196
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:30,000
and I got selected here, then

1197
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:31,760
I told my rejection in my old company.

1198
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,880
Resign Resign

1199
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:39,760
Resigned, submitted my resignation letter,

1200
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,680
then after three months, I

1201
00:55:41,880 --> 00:55:43,680
joined my current company, whose name is

1202
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,440
DS Plus, now I work here

1203
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,320
even today and this company of ours

1204
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:52,150
is completely remote, so I am still working there.

1205
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,680
itself and everything is going well,

1206
00:55:55,080 --> 00:55:55,920
life is good, I am

1207
00:56:27,640 --> 00:56:29,870
living like any software engineer earns, I am living like that, there is

1208
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:32,640
no problem but there are still a lot of things to do

1209
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:34,680
as I wanted to study but

1210
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,830
not get the resources, I did not find any good teacher

1211
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,560
due to which a lot of my

1212
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,760
time was wasted, at one time I found a good teacher

1213
00:56:42,120 --> 00:56:44,360
and then I was able to study, so I

1214
00:56:44,560 --> 00:56:47,000
believe that almost every child wants to study,

1215
00:56:47,240 --> 00:56:49,280
basically most of the children want to study,

1216
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,760
some

1217
00:56:52,080 --> 00:56:54,280
want to study, if they are not able to study, then there is

1218
00:56:54,440 --> 00:56:56,640
lack of main resources, there is

1219
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:00,840
lack of good teachers, so my goal is

1220
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,110
that if any child wants to learn web development,

1221
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:06,720
then he should not feel the lack of resources.

1222
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:10,440
Yes, it should be easy to learn and in

1223
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:11,960
depth in details, just

1224
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:17,880
like two plus two is four,

1225
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,480
we have no doubt in this, similarly if

1226
00:57:20,680 --> 00:57:22,400
someone teaches web development then it will

1227
00:57:22,560 --> 00:57:25,120
be as clear as two plus two is four.

1228
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:27,840
that way, only when there is clarity,

1229
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,760
you are able to do something, then that clarity

1230
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,560
is important and presence of a good teacher is important.

1231
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,280
Presence of a good course is

1232
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,830
important, that is why I have made my complete front end

1233
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:42,240
course of 148 145 hours.

1234
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,720
course is a long course, it will take time, if you

1235
00:57:45,840 --> 00:57:49,440
follow it, it may take 6 to 8 months, it may

1236
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,600
even take 9 months,

1237
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:55,840
depending on how much you can learn

1238
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,840
in a day, if you follow that course.

1239
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,400
complete it completely, then you

1240
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:06,760
can also get a job as an Experience Developer, that is, you

1241
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:08,920
can also get an interview for an Experience Developer,

1242
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,310
I have covered so many things well there, I have

1243
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,270
made and completed the entire course of Front End on

1244
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,800
our

1245
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,560
youtube3.

1246
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:21,440
course is needed by many children in our country. There are

1247
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:23,800
many children in India

1248
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,110
who want to learn but they are not

1249
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,400
getting the right course, are

1250
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:30,840
not getting the right guidance, are not getting the right teacher.

1251
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:34,030
If so, share this course as much as possible,

1252
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,120
this channel with your friends or

1253
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:39,720
children who are

1254
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:41,560
interested in learning web development.

1255
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,480
Tell them about this course

1256
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,680
so that they can learn well what they want to learn.

1257
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:47,680
Get it and if any

1258
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,790
doubt comes while learning then I do it live on Google3 every Sunday from

1259
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:52,440
8 pm to 11:00 pm

1260
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,080
and I sit for about 3 hours and

1261
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,880
any child can come and ask his/her doubts there for free.

1262
00:58:57,080 --> 00:58:59,800
All the children come

1263
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:03,200
every day, we do this every Sunday, from

1264
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:05,390
8 to 12 in the night, anyone can join the G Meet and

1265
00:59:05,560 --> 00:59:07,320
ask their doubts for free and

1266
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,160
we have a Telegram group where

1267
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,240
children help each other.

1268
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:15,080
anyone can join that group who is

1269
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,720
learning and can take help from other children and

1270
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,280
clear their doubts, so

1271
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:23,920
this is my attempt to do

1272
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,630
something for our country, such children who are helpless.

1273
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:28,910
who are not getting the course, are

1274
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:31,720
not getting the right teacher, this course should

1275
00:59:31,960 --> 00:59:35,240
reach them and they should be able to learn, this is just my

1276
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,520
effort from my side, let me make one thing

1277
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,040
clear here that if my course is free then only

1278
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,200
free courses are good.

1279
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:43,800
teach for free or those who teach for free are good, those

1280
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,350
who teach paid courses are bad, it is

1281
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,560
not so, whoever is the

1282
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:50,680
instructor, whoever is teaching through paid courses

1283
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:53,200
or is teaching for free, howsoever he

1284
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:55,640
is teaching, all are good.

1285
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:58,030
learned is that my life has changed because of a paid

1286
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:00,520
course, so it does not happen

1287
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:02,280
that if someone is making a paid course then he is a

1288
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,360
scam. Never

1289
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,710
look at a paid course and call it a scam, it is okay.

1290
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:10,720
I have learned from paid courses only, I have

1291
01:00:10,880 --> 01:00:13,760
taken many paid courses, if you

1292
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,550
cannot afford that course it means simply

1293
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:17,960
that course is not for you, okay if you

1294
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,680
can afford it comfortably then that course

1295
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,160
is for you.

1296
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:24,550
made this entire course for free, so

1297
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:27,040
anyone can access it, now anyone

1298
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:28,760
can access it, the down side of this is

1299
01:00:28,880 --> 01:00:30,600
that many people will start and

1300
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,640
leave in the middle because of some commitment.

1301
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:34,830
Nothing will be left for them, no, if someone

1302
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:37,040
starts a paid course after watching it, then at

1303
01:00:37,240 --> 01:00:38,880
least because of the money, he keeps learning.

1304
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:40,640
My motivation for making this course is

1305
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,400
that if any child in our country

1306
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,680
wants to learn web development.

1307
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:48,560
due to lack of resources, he should never have the

1308
01:00:49,040 --> 01:00:51,320
feeling of being helpless, just like I had the

1309
01:00:51,600 --> 01:00:53,520
feeling once when I had to

1310
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:56,160
learn Physics, I was

1311
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:57,590
not able to find any good teacher, no one was explaining it well,

1312
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,880
that feeling of helplessness.

1313
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:02,680
is very bad, so my

1314
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:04,550
goal is that this course should reach every child,

1315
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:06,720
I will give you the link of this course

1316
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,680
in the description of the video and if you

1317
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:10,160
follow my course, you

1318
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,000
will notice one thing that I never

1319
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,870
n't say like share subscribe in any video

1320
01:01:15,720 --> 01:01:17,480
because I don't like it, I find it

1321
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,040
a bit distracting, I have

1322
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:22,160
not come here to like share subscribe, I will

1323
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,360
get that, I don't have it, I

1324
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,240
find it distracting, basically it

1325
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:30,070
doesn't suit me.

1326
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:32,680
bell icon, till date I have never said

1327
01:01:32,800 --> 01:01:34,480
share subscribe in any video,

1328
01:01:35,160 --> 01:01:37,030
maybe I say comment comment in some comment, if there

1329
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,720
is any doubt then you can ask by commenting

1330
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:41,960
but share subscribe in every video

1331
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,640
people like

1332
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,030
come, then the force bell will come, then it will ring,

1333
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:49,110
press the bell on this, I never say all this,

1334
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,960
so it does not mean that you do not have to

1335
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:55,600
support, whatever you can do,

1336
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,070
you support.

1337
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,560
course should reach the children in some way, no matter

1338
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,720
how they download it, whatever they do, they

1339
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,440
watch it. I don't care about likes, shares, subscriptions or

1340
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,960
views, just that it should reach them so that

1341
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,480
they know that there is something like this.

1342
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,600
keep it in my local and watch it, I will not

1343
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,800
get views. It doesn't matter whether I download it or

1344
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:18,600
watch it, the only thing that matters to me is

1345
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:20,800
that any child who

1346
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:23,880
is helpless, who is in need, should go to this course.

1347
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:41,760
How can it be done without a degree.

1348
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:42,920
and now I am working on

1349
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,920
youtube2. If you are in any adverse session,

1350
01:02:55,120 --> 01:02:58,040
but if you get good guidance, you get a

1351
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:00,120
good course, you

1352
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:02,590
get a good teacher and if you have the

1353
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,800
passion to learn, that is commitment.

1354
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:08,040
meet me in your course

1355
01:03:08,120 --> 01:03:09,840
till then bye bye
